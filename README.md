The simulator allows you to generate planes that will land or take off, the process of landing and takeoff takes place at the discretion of the dispatcher who is responsible for coordinating traffic at the airport. Each landing / takeoff process has its own route consisting of a set of stations, after receiving permission from the controller, the aircraft begins to move along the entire route, delaying for a certain time at each station until it reaches the final station. the simulator also allows you to see the list of flights, get information about the state of each station in real time, and visually to see the airport.
